# haf's shell scripts and dotfiles

Uses primarily the [zsh4humans setup](https://github.com/romkatv/zsh4humans), updated with `z4h update`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/haf/macos.git && cd macos
./setup.sh
```

## Aims

- Fully functional on M1 MacBook Pro laptops after running setup.sh
- A fully functional development environment for a handful of languages
- Extremely good zsh configuration because I spend so much time in that shell:
  * Should load very quickly
  * Should make it *very* hard to make mistakes
  * Should automatically load the right virtualenv for python
- Default to the latest and most modern releases of things and install switchers for older versions
